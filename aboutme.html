  <p class="anec background"> Hello! My name is Oltiona Perovic, and I am the creator of this website.

   <p class="anec"> 
    The meaning behind this page is to give everyone an understanding of why procrastination is distracting our daily productive lives, and remedies to try and stop oursleves from continuously procrastinating. As a procrastinator myself, I tend to struggle with assignments and projects not because they are challenging, but because the process of doing the assignment seems too long for my brain to cooperate, and I give up in doing assignments. I will say, doing this project was a challenge, as my brain can't focus on a certain assignment for too long without losing motivation. Thanks to many people who helped me with this project, such as Kayla, Adonese, and other people from my SEP class, they helped me not only by giving feedback and certain instructions/codes, but by giving me motivation, something I truly value in them.</p>
