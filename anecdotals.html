      <p class="anec"> 	Many teenagers and college students usually face the most amount of procrastination. I don’t blame them, though. The amount of work, mental health problems, many personal problems, and we all have to deal with it while trying to study for an exam. Here are some anecdotes from many other people that have faced the same situation we go through. From trying to memorize a song, to drawing in wet concrete, to actually not wanting to be a part of the outside world, there are many types of procrastination.Student Sophia Giles dealt with a very common type of procrastination, watching or listening to videos on Youtube. The rapper Azealia Banks came with a new rap song, which Sophia had to listen to, and memorize. So, instead of writing her essay, she decided to memorize a whole rap song for the most of the time. Instead of writing essays for school, Raen Waghorn-Hughes and his friend decided to sketch on wet concrete( I was a bit confused on this anecdote as well). Now finally, the one that is pretty dark. College student Patrick Lenton decided to do a degree that was not suitable for is mental health. When he graduated, he felt like he didn’t want to be outside anymore,to not be a part of reality, because communication really wasn’t a thing for him while his time in the art degree.
